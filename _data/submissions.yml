  - title: "Ally - A gentle, accessibility-first path to consensus"
    repo_url: "https://github.com/chiace/htpac25"
    description: "Ally is an accessibility-first consensus platform that turns complex discussions into clear, accountable decisions. Teams capture input as structured items: claims, use cases, proposals, implementation notes, and accessibility concerns, then evaluate them with agreement sliders and explicit objections (non-blocking or blocking). A Consensus Health dashboard surfaces what needs attention now: civility index, participation trends, time-to-decision, and objection hotspots. Ally encourages kind collaboration with a tone helper (NVC prompts) and steel-manning before replies, reducing friction while keeping rigor. Outcomes are exported as clean decision records (Markdown/JSON) to drop into GitHub issues and W3C minutes, preserving provenance and accountability. Built for standards work, Ally blends redundancy, resilience, simplicity, and empathy, so groups can make complexity kind and move from discussion to definition."
